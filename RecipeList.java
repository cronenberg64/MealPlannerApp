// possible idea here to add another class, this one you can add recipes you know of at home
// they'll have the nutrient counter as well and the recipes are stored in a RecipeList

// also need to take into account when you don't eat meals from the menu, maybe add a feature
// to manually add nutrientCount and what not

public class RecipeList {
