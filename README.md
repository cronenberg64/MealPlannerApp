# MealPlannerApp
I'm making a java project that'll help track your meals and diet goals

For context, this is a project that I've decided to work on for my university course's final assignment which is to make a "mini app"
on java and implement some features but I've went ahead and modified my code again so that I can actually call it a finished product.

I also have some documentation which was required for my assignment but I figured I'd upload it anyways because I like keeping some documentation and keeping my files tidy. It's worth noting that the documentation is not up to date to the current version as the documentation also accounts for the version that I submitted to my course assignment tab but aside from the code explanation the rest should be the same.

If anyone would like to expand this project you may feel free to do so or youu may also contact me
Thank you.
